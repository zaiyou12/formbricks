# Migration Guide

## v1.6

Formbricks v1.6 comes with a big new features like Advanced Targeting & Segmentation of your end-users along with on-the-fly triggers for surveys and a ton of stability improvements & features. This also involves a few changes in our environment variables. This guide will help you migrate your existing Formbricks instance to v1.6 without any hassles or build errors.

<Note>
  This upgrade requires a **data migration**. Please make sure to backup your database before proceeding with
  the upgrade. Follow the below steps thoroughly to upgrade your Formbricks instance to v1.6.
</Note>

### Steps to Migrate

This guide is for users who are self-hosting Formbricks using our one-click setup. If you are using a different setup, you might adjust the commands accordingly.

To run all these steps, please navigate to the `formbricks` folder where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

1. **Backup your Database**: This is a crucial step. Please make sure to backup your database before proceeding with the upgrade. You can use the following command to backup your database:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Backup Postgres">

```bash
docker exec formbricks-quickstart-postgres-1 pg_dump -U postgres -d formbricks > formbricks_pre_v1.6_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

2. Stop the running Formbricks instance & remove the related containers:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Stop the containers">

```bash
docker-compose down
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

3. Restarting the containers will automatically pull the latest version of Formbricks:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Restart the containers">

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

4. Now let's migrate the data to the latest schema:

<Note>To find your Docker Network name for your Postgres Database, find it using `docker network ps`</Note>

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Migrate the data">

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --network=formbricks_default \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/formbricks?schema=public" \
  -e UPGRADE_TO_VERSION="v1.6" \
  ghcr.io/formbricks/data-migrations:v1.6
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

The above command will migrate your data to the latest schema. This is a crucial step to migrate your existing data to the new structure. Only if the script runs successful, changes are made to the database. The script can safely run multiple times.

5. That's it! Once the migration is complete, you can **now access your Formbricks instance** at the same URL as before.

### In-App Surveys with @formbricks/js

If you are using the `@formbricks/js` package, please make sure to update it to version 1.6.0 to use the latest features and improvements.

### Deprecated Environment Variables

| Environment Variable | Comments                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GITHUB_AUTH_ENABLED  | Was used to enable GitHub OAuth, but from v1.6, you can just set the `GITHUB_ID` and `GITHUB_SECRET` environment variables.                                     |
| GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED  | Was used to enable Google OAuth, but from v1.6, you can just set the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.                       |
| AZUREAD_AUTH_ENABLED | Was used to enable AzureAD OAuth, but from v1.6, you can just set the `AZUREAD_CLIENT_ID`, `AZUREAD_CLIENT_SECRET` & `AZUREAD_TENANT_ID` environment variables. |

## v1.2

Formbricks v1.2 ships a lot of features targeting our Link Surveys. We have also improved our security posture to be as robust as ever. However, it also comes with a few breaking changes specifically with the environment variables. This guide will help you migrate your existing Formbricks instance to v1.2 without any hassles or build errors.

### New Environment Variables

| Environment Variable | Required | Recommended Generation  | Comments                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ENCRYPTION_KEY       | true     | `openssl rand -hex 32`  | Needed for 2 Factor Authentication                          |
| SHORT_URL_BASE       | false    | `<your-short-base-url>` | Needed if you want to enable shorter links for Link Surveys |

### Deprecated / Removed Environment Variables

| Environment Variable | Comments                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SURVEY_BASE_URL      | The WEBAPP_URL is now used to determine the survey base url in all places |

## v1.1

Formbricks v1.1 includes a lot of new features and improvements. However, it also comes with a few breaking changes specifically with the environment variables. This guide will help you migrate your existing Formbricks instance to v1.1 without losing any data.

### Renamed Environment Variables

This was introduced because we got a lot of requests from our users for the ability to define some common environment variables at runtime itself i.e. without having to rebuild the image for the changes to take effect.
This is now possible with v1.1. However, due to Next.JS best practices, we had to deprecate the prefix **NEXT*PUBLIC*** in the following environment variables:

| till v1.0                                   | v1.1                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***EMAIL_VERIFICATION_DISABLED | EMAIL_VERIFICATION_DISABLED |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***PASSWORD_RESET_DISABLED     | PASSWORD_RESET_DISABLED     |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***SIGNUP_DISABLED             | SIGNUP_DISABLED             |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***INVITE_DISABLED             | INVITE_DISABLED             |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***PRIVACY_URL                 | PRIVACY_URL                 |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***TERMS_URL                   | TERMS_URL                   |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***IMPRINT_URL                 | IMPRINT_URL                 |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***GITHUB_AUTH_ENABLED         | GITHUB_AUTH_ENABLED         |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED         | GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED         |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***WEBAPP_URL                  | WEBAPP_URL                  |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***IS_FORMBRICKS_CLOUD         | IS_FORMBRICKS_CLOUD         |
| **NEXT*PUBLIC***SURVEY_BASE_URL             | SURVEY_BASE_URL             |

<Note>
  Please note that their values and the logic remains exactly the same. Only the prefix has been deprecated.
  The other environment variables remain the same as well.
</Note>

### Deprecated Environment Variables

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL**: Was used as Vercel URL (used instead of WEBAPP_URL), but from v1.1, you can just set the WEBAPP_URL environment variable to your Vercel URL.
- **RAILWAY_STATIC_URL**: Was used as Railway Static URL (used instead of WEBAPP_URL), but from v1.1, you can just set the WEBAPP_URL environment variable.
- **RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL**: Was used as an external URL to Render (used instead of WEBAPP_URL), but from v1.1, you can just set the WEBAPP_URL environment variable.
- **HEROKU_APP_NAME**: Was used to build the App name on a Heroku hosted webapp, but from v1.1, you can just set the WEBAPP_URL environment variable.
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL**: Was used for the same purpose as WEBAPP_URL, but from v1.1, you can just set the WEBAPP_URL environment variable.
- **PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY**: Was used to tell Prisma that it should generate the runtime for Dataproxy usage. But its officially deprecated now.

### Helper Shell Script

For a seamless migration, below is a shell script for your self-hosted instance that will automatically update your environment variables to be compliant with the new naming conventions.

### Docker & Single Script Setup

Now that these variables can be defined at runtime, you can append them inside your `x-environment` in the `docker-compose.yml` itself.
For a more detailed guide on these environment variables, please refer to the [Important Runtime Variables](/docs/self-hosting/docker#important-run-time-variables) section.
