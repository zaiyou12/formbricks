_Get a quick intro to the Formbricks community, also known as FormTribe, and learn all the deets about making awesome contributions to the project._

## Welcome to the Formbricks community!

We are so excited to have you with us üòä

In this post we will be helping you get familiar with the Formbricks codebase and get you up to speed contributing in no time. If you want to learn about Formbricks check out our [docs intro](https://formbricks.com/docs/introduction/what-is-formbricks), for more info about our founding story and why we're building open source checkout out our [blog](https://formbricks.com/blog).

### Prerequisites

Our codebase is written fully in Typescript and we love it üòç. To power our the experience management solution, here is the stack behind it all:

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - ORM

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Language

[Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) - Icons

[TalwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styling

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) - Validation

[Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) - Authentication

### üòé Installation and Setup

To get up and running we have 2 options: Gitpod and local.

#### Get started with Gitpod

With Gitpod you can run all of Formbricks in the cloud. With one click you can start coding right away in your browser:

[Read more in our docs](https://formbricks.com/docs/contributing/setup#gitpod-guide)

#### Run on a local machine

If you choose to get setup locally, we also have a well documented guide to hold you through the process, you can find it [here](https://formbricks.com/docs/contributing/setup)

### üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Codebase Overview

Our codebase is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) which means we have different projects in one repository. At moment we have 3 different projects:

1. **demo** `apps/demo` - It's a simple React app that you can run locally and use to trigger actions and set¬†**[Attributes](https://formbricks.com/docs/attributes/why)**. It allows you to test your setup easily.
2. **formbricks-com** `apps/formbricks-com` - The landing page of [Formbricks](https://formbricks.com)
3. **web** `apps/web` - Our [cloud offering](https://app.formbricks.com/) for Formbricks.

#### TurboRepo and our own packages

To manage all of these projects in one repository we use [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos). Depending on what part of the codebase you need to contribute in, now you know where to begin üòÉ

We also have a set of packages which we manage: They are located in the `packages` folder. There we keep our styling library, components, database migrations and connection, a couple of configurations and much more. We do this to use any of these packages seamlessly between our mono repos.
