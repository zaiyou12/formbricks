As users navigate your website, their feedback serves as a compass, guiding you toward improvements that resonate with them. Feedback from users provides valuable insights into areas where they might be facing challenges or experiencing dissatisfaction. This information is instrumental in identifying and rectifying pain points within your website's design, navigation, or functionality.

But how do you get this feedback?

Thatâ€™s where **website feedback tools** come into play. The best website feedback tools play a crucial role in both enhancing the user experience and optimizing conversion rates. These tools are usually equipped with features like:

- Targeted surveys and
- Visual feedback options like screen recordings and 

However, choosing the right tool is where the problem may lie. Among the myriad of website feedback tools, this article will uncover 10 of the top recommended tools, each distinguished by a unique feature that sets it apart from the rest.

The water's fine; let's dive in headfirst. ðŸ¤¸

## The 10 Best Website Feedback Tools 2024

Weâ€™ll categorize the website tools highlighted in this section into three categories.

1. Website Voice Of The Customer (VoC) Feedback Tools
2. Community Feedback Tools
3. Behavioral Analysis Tools

Website VoC Feedback Tools focus on understanding and enhancing user experiences; Community Feedback Tools emphasize collaboration and innovation; and Behavioral Analysis Tools provide deep insights for informed decision-making. These tools ensure businesses not only meet user expectations but also stay agile and competitive in the evolving online environment.

As we explore each tool within these categories, we'll explore their vital roles in the digital landscape, their unique approach to how they offer their services and their shortcomings.

## Website voice of the customer (VoC) feedback tools

These tools, as weâ€™ll see, are tools that help you collect and analyze the opinions and experiences of your website visitors. They gather user data through surveys, providing valuable insights into how users interact with your website and what they think about it. The surveys may take various forms, including CSAT, CES, and NPS, as well as polls and quizzes.

### Formbricks

<Image
  src={Formbricks}
  alt="Formbricks is a free and open source survey software for in app micro surveys. Ask any user segment at any point in the user journey."
  className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Formbricks is a unique open-source experience management platform designed to facilitate the collection of qualitative user feedback through highly customizable surveys at various touchpoints in your users' journey. It allows you to create multiple survey types, including CSAT, NPS, and CES, to gather insights effectively.

These surveys can be seamlessly embedded into your design, ensuring feedback is collected at key moments without disrupting the user flow. Alternatively, you can share survey links to gather feedback from diverse online sources, such as social media or blog posts.

#### Unique Approach

Formbricks stands out in its trigger versatility by offering an array of generic triggers to initiate surveys. These triggers include New Session, Exit Intent, 50% scroll, created new event, updated
accessibility, received booking requests, invited team member, created new workflow, and viewed insights. This flexibility ensures your surveys appear at precise moments of relevance to maximize their impact.

Moreover, Formbricks takes customization a step further by allowing users to create bespoke triggers tailored to specific needs. Whether it's based on the URL, innerText, or CSS selectors, you can set up triggers that align precisely with your unique goals. This allows you to trigger surveys based on the exact content the user sees or even interactions with specific buttons or sections.

Additionally, the platform provides actionable insights through intuitive dashboards, making it easy to derive meaningful conclusions from the collected feedback.

#### Shortcomings

Formbricks is still very young and doesnâ€™t integrate with as many
third-party tools, although it integrates with popular third-party tools
like Slack, Make.com, and Notion. However, the Formbricks team and open
source community is working on adding more all the time.

**Overall**, Formbricks is built on the largest open source survey infrastructure on GitHub. This ensures a privacy-first approach to gathering and analyzing user feedback. You can [get started](http://formbricks.com/) with a free plan and experience that modern open source software can be even more user-friendly than proprietary solutions.

### SurveyMonkey

SurveyMonkey is a widely used survey platform offering a robust suite of survey features to cater to diverse needs and research goals.

#### Unique Approach

With SurveyMonkey, you have the flexibility to start building your surveys from scratch or utilize the AI (which is backed by openAI) to build templates for you. All you need to do is write a prompt that
includes your survey goals, and AI will do the rest.

It also enables you to integrate your survey data with over 175 third-party tools in your stack, including CMS and marketing automation tools, among others.

#### Shortcoming

SurveyMonkey has been around for over 20 years and looks and feels like that. While it is a proven solution for enterprise buyers, most smaller companies might find it bulky.

**Overall**, whether you are an individual, a business, or even an educator who needs to design polls and quizzes for classroom engagement and gather student feedback, SurveyMonkey can do it.

### Mopinion

<Image
  src={Mopinion}
  alt="Mopinion is a user feedback software with features to create online surveys."
  className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Mopinion is a user feedback software with features to create online surveys. With Mopinion, you donâ€™t just get feedback; it also offers in-depth analysis opportunities on the feedback for you through data visualization on a customizable dashboard.

#### Unique Approach

What's special about Mopinion is its user-friendly features, like drag-and-drop when you're building your forms. You can make feedback forms for all your digital channels easily. One unique thing is that it offers a fully native SDK for Android and iOS, meaning you can put it right into your app. And if you're into self-hosting to keep more control over your data, Mopinion lets you create self-hosted surveys too.

#### Shortcoming

While Mopinion offers robust features, businesses may find the learning curve for the advanced functionalities quite steep. Users may need some time to familiarize themselves with the platform's
capabilities, especially when creating customized surveys or integrating with various third-party tools

**Overall**, Mopinion plays well with other tools too. It integrates smoothly with third-party tools such as Slack, Google Analytics, Jira, Hubspot, Salesforce, and many more.

### Qualaroo

  src={Qualaroo}
  alt="Qualaroo is a user feedback and survey platform designed to help businesses understand the needs and preferences of their website visitors. Qualaroo is geared towards capturing real-time insights from website users."
  className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>
Qualaroo is a user feedback and survey platform designed to help businesses understand the needs and preferences of their website visitors. Qualaroo is geared towards capturing real-time insights from website users to enhance the user experience and inform business decisions.

It does this through something called "Nudges" â€“ these are subtle little surveys that pop up at just the right times on your website. They don't interrupt what visitors are doing; instead, they smoothly blend into the user's journey.

With Qualaroo, you have different survey types to choose from, like custom surveys, NPS (Net Promoter Score), PMF (Product-Market Fit), and on-site surveys. Plus, there's a special dashboard just for NPS surveys that lets you keep an eye on scores in real time.

What's cool is that you can customize these surveys to target specific user behaviors. You can ask for feedback based on where users are, who they are, when they visit, and more; it's like tailoring questions to fit the person.

#### Unique Approach

Qualaroo stands out with its innovative approach to gathering user insights. It leverages unobtrusive survey "Nudges" that appear at strategic moments on a website.

#### Shortcoming

There may be a risk of feedback bias since users can choose whether or not to engage with the Nudges.

**Overall**, Qualaroo plays well with other popular tools that businesses use. So, whether you're a small startup or a big corporation, Qualaroo is here to make your website the best it can be.

### 2. Community Feedback Tools

These are platforms designed to facilitate and manage feedback from a community of users or customers of a business. With these tools, you can gather opinions, suggestions, and insights from a group of people who share a common interest or connection, such as users of a particular
product, members of an online community, or participants in a specific project.

### IdeaScale

<Image
  src={IdeaScale}
  alt="IdeaScale is an innovation management solution that links organizations to people with ideas."
  className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

IdeaScale describes itself as an innovation management solution that links organizations to people with ideas.

### Unique Approach

IdeaScale stands out in its approach to connecting organizations with people who contribute ideas by providing an idea hub for users to submit and discuss ideas openly. Some of its other features on this platform include an idea submission feature, which enables you to easily share an idea and add all the relevant details so that anyone can view, validate, or add to that idea; a similarity search to reduce redundancy by proactively searching for similar ideas; and idea linking and annotations to identify trends and relationships between ideas by linking ideas and showcasing how they build on one another.

### Shortcoming

Nonetheless, while IdeaScale offers valuable features, it presents the challenge of managing large volumes of ideas. As the platform encourages open submission, there might be a need for effective mechanisms to sift through and prioritize ideas, ensuring that valuable contributions receive due attention.

**Overall,** IdeaScale facilitates the collaborative exchange of insights, making it a valuable tool for businesses seeking feedback and innovation from their community.

### UserReport

<Image
  src={UserReport}
  alt="UserReport helps you resonate with your users."
  className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

UserReport helps you resonate with your users. It tells you who your users are and what they want to achieve. It is based primarily on two features, the survey widget and the feedback widget.

#### Unique Approach

Through its survey widget, the tool gathers essential information about your website visitors. However, it's the feedback widget that transforms UserReport into a dynamic space for community engagement. Here, users actively participate by posting, voting on, and discussing ideas. This active involvement shifts the tool from a passive data collector to a platform where users contribute thoughts and opinions, essentially becoming co-creators in shaping the direction of your
platform.

#### Shortcoming

However, as with any community-driven tool, managing and prioritizing a large volume of user-generated content may pose a challenge. Additionally, the effectiveness of UserReport relies heavily on users actively participating in surveys, providing feedback, and contributing ideas. Hence, if user engagement is low, the platform may not harness its full potential.

**Overall**, with UserReport, you're not just getting data; you're building a bridge to your users' thoughts and creating a vibrant community where everyone's voice matters.

### Sprinklr Social

<Image
  src={Sprinklr}
  alt="Sprinklr is a platform for unified customer experience management."
  className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Sprinklr boasts of being the first platform purpose-built for unified customer experience management.

#### Unique Approach

It introduces the concept of social listening through its comprehensive product suite, notably Sprinklr Social, a standout among G2â€™s Top 50 Products for Marketers. Unlike traditional customer experience platforms, Sprinklr Social goes beyond managing online presence; it delves into social listening, actively engaging businesses with their audience.

Sprinklr Social is a comprehensive tool that helps businesses manage their online presence, engage with their audience, and gather valuable insights just from its centralized dashboard.

#### Shortcoming

However, despite Sprinklrâ€™s strength, businesses might face a learning curve in fully harnessing the platform's capabilities. The need for training and support to navigate and utilize all aspects efficiently could be a consideration before using this tool.

In essence, Sprinklr serves as a community feedback tool by not only allowing businesses to listen to their audience but also by actively engaging with the community, gathering feedback, and fostering meaningful interactions across various social media platforms.

### 3. Behavioural Analysis Tools

These tools go beyond traditional analytics tools that track page views and clicks. They go deeper into how a user behaves on your website, user motivations, and pain points. A typical behavioral
analysis tool will offer features like session recordings, heatmaps, and funnels.

Letâ€™s have a look at three of the recommended ones.

### Hotjar

<Image
  src={Hotjar}
  alt="Hotjar is a powerful behavioral analysis tool that lets you see, understand, and optimize how people interact with your website."
  className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Hotjar is a powerful behavioral analysis tool that lets you see, understand, and optimize how people interact with your website.

#### Unique Approach

With Hotjar, when you sign up, you get several behavior analytics tools all at once, all from the same dashboard. These tools, including heatmaps and recordings, help you see whatâ€™s happening with users on your website.

#### Shortcoming

A potential shortcoming of Hotjar lies in its data sampling approach, particularly in standard plans. Users are limited to reviewing only a fraction of the entire dataset collected daily. For instance, if you have 3000 recordings per month, they are restricted to analyzing just 100 daily sessions. This sampling limitation could pose challenges for businesses aiming to conduct a comprehensive analysis of user interactions, potentially impacting the depth and accuracy of insights derived from the collected data.

**Overall**, Hotjar integrates with a wide range of third-party tools you may already be using. This makes it particularly suitable for you if you are an enterprise with diverse third-party tools in your tech stack, as it complements and enhances your existing analytics ecosystem.

### Usersnap

<Image
  src={UserSnap}
  alt="Usersnap is a visual feedback and bug-tracking tool that helps you to capture, organize, respond to, and scale user feedback all in one place."
  className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

Usersnap is a visual feedback and bug-tracking tool that helps you to capture, organize, respond to, and scale user feedback all in one place.

#### Unique Approach

At its core, Usersnap revolutionizes user interaction insights by offering a robust platform for capturing screenshots and annotating them. This visual feedback becomes a crucial lens through which development and design teams can analyze how users engage with various elements on a website, gaining qualitative insights into preferences, pain points, and areas of interest.

#### Shortcoming

Some of its users complain of the absence of search functionality or filtering options within the list of submitted feedback. Users navigating through their feedback submissions cannot efficiently search for specific types of feedback or filter submissions based on criteria. This limitation can hinder users' ability to quickly locate and review particular feedback instances or determine whether they have previously submitted similar feedback.

**Overall,** Usersnap integrates with popular collaboration tools such as Jira, Slack, and Trello. This ensures that the behavioral insights gleaned from Usersnap are seamlessly woven into broader project workflows, fostering collaboration and informed decision-making.

### CrazyEgg

<Image
  src={CrazyEgg}
  alt="CrazyEgg gives you visual insights into how people interact with your website, helping you see patterns, identify pain points, and optimize for success."
  className="rounded-lg w-full"
/>

CrazyEgg gives you visual insights into how people interact with your website, helping you see patterns, identify pain points, and optimize for success.

#### Unique Approach

With CrazyEgg session recordings, you can watch your users click, scroll, and navigate through your website just like you are virtually standing right beside them.

On the other hand, CrazyEgg boasts of being the originator of webpage heatmap technology. It takes a snapshot of your web pages and creates heatmaps showing where users focus the most. But that's not all â€“ you also get four other reports: the Scrollmap report, Confetti report, Overlay report, and List report. Each report gives you more insights into how users engage with your site. If you're curious about these reports, you can check out their website for detailed information.

#### Shortcoming

A notable challenge reported by users of CrazyEgg is the perceived lack of detailed reporting within the platform. Feedback suggests that the existing reporting features may not provide users with sufficient depth of information, leaving them wanting more comprehensive insights. The perceived limitation in detailed reporting could impact the platform's effectiveness for users who seek in-depth analytics to drive strategic improvements on their websites.

**Overall**, CrazyEgg stands out for its innovative approach to behavioral analysis and its role in enhancing website optimization strategies.

## In Conclusion

Website feedback tools offer businesses many possibilities to make websites better for users and increase how many people take desired actions. One tool, CrazyEgg, gives visual insights and real-time feedback, helping businesses understand how users interact with their websites. It lets you watch users move through the website and see patterns with session recordings and heatmaps.

Each tool, like Formbricks, plays a crucial role in improving digital experiences. Formbricks, especially, is unique as it is built on an open-source platform.
